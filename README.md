LiveChat app built with MERN Stack + Firebase for login.


About the app:
A classic live chat application built with ReactJS on the Front-end and with NodeJS (Express & MongoDB) + Google Firebase on the Back-end.

User can talk on various chat rooms and can edit or delete his own messages.

I added 3 extra features: Google Authentication,  User Profile and Music Library. 
Its always nice to listen to some music while chatting.
